Issue a HTTPS GET request to:

https://api.mysportsfeeds.com/v2.1/pull/nba/{season}/date/{date}/games.{format}
with optional parameters:

team={list-of-teams} (filter teams)
status={list-of-game-statuses} (filter game statuses)
sort={sort-specifier} (sort the feed's content)
offset={offset-specifier} (filter results starting at the given offset)
limit={limit-specifier} (limit the maximum # of results)
force={force-if-not-modified} (force content)

where:

Parameter	Description
{season}	
a value obtained by concatenating

(season start year) + "-" +
(season end year) + "-" +
either "regular" or "playoff", depending on the season's type

Note: if the starting and ending years are the same, you can just specify the single year.

You can also use the special keywords current, latest or upcoming.

Using current relates to the current in-progress season (whether regular or playoff). If a current season is not in progress (offseason), you'll receive an empty response with response code 400. Using latest will return the latest season (whether regular or playoff).

Note that current and latest will in fact apply to the same season if a season is in progress.

Using upcoming will only apply to a season which has been added, but has not yet actually started. This applies in cases where the upcoming season's game schedule is available, but there is no curent season underway (offseason, or between regular and playoff seasons). If no applicable season is available, an empty 400 response is returned.

Valid examples are:

2016-2017-regular
2016-playoff
current
latest
upcoming
{date}	a valid date in the form of YYYYMMDD
{format}	one of csv, xml, or json
team={list-of-teams}	(optional) comma-delimited list of one or more teams.

If this parameter is omitted, by default ALL teams are included.
In addition, for either the player_gamelogs or team_gamelogs, at least one player, team, or game MUST be specified.


There are several acceptable formats for a team. Each is case-insensitive, and strips out any punctuation.

Team ID:
24
Team abbreviation:
bos
City and team name:
boston-celtics
status={list-of-game-statuses}	(optional) comma-delimited list of one or more game statuses.

If this parameter is omitted, by default ALL game statuses are included.

Values are case-insensitive, supported values are:
unplayed (scheduled but not yet started)
in-progress (currently underway)
postgame-reviewing (game is over, but we're reviewing against official sources)
final (game is final and reviewed)
sort={sort-specifier}	(optional) Specifies a sorting order for the results. Format is:

{prefix}.{value}.{sort-order}

The {sort-order} is optional, and must be either "A" for Ascending, or "D" for descending.

Valid values for this feed are:
game.starttime
offset={offset-specifier}	(optional) Specifies the starting offset for the results. Defaults to 0.
limit={limit-specifier}	(optional) Specifies the maxmimum number of results. If not specified, all results are returned.
force={force-if-not-modified}	(optional) Valid values are true or false.

Specifies whether to "force" content to be returned and avoid an empty 304 response. (See Response Codes section for more details)

Defaults to "true", which will always return the most up-to-date content based on your subscription level.

Specifying "false" will also avoid any throttling restrictions on your requests. See the Throttling section for more.
