Here's a highly detailed breakdown of **MySportsFeeds API documentation for NBA Stats integration**:[1]

***

**Getting Started & Authentication:**
- **API Keys:** Sign up and manage your API keys from your account. All versions use the same key.
- **Authentication:** Use HTTP Basic Auth in the `Authorization` header. For version 2.x, password is `"MYSPORTSFEEDS"`.
    - The header value: `Authorization: Basic {base64(api_key_token:MYSPORTSFEEDS)}`
    - Example cURL:
      ```bash
      curl -X "GET" "https://api.mysportsfeeds.com/v2.1/pull/nba/2025-2026-regular/player_stats.json" \
      -u "api_key_token:MYSPORTSFEEDS" \
      --compress
      ```
- **Security:** All requests secured over SSL (HTTPS).

***

**Available Formats:**
- JSON, XML, CSV (for Excel/import)

**Request URL Syntax:**
- Format for NBA stats:
  ```
  https://api.mysportsfeeds.com/v2.1/pull/nba/{season}/{feed}.{format}
  ```
  Example:
  ```
  https://api.mysportsfeeds.com/v2.1/pull/nba/2025-2026-regular/player_stats.json
  ```

**Parameters:**
- `season`: e.g. `2025-2026-regular`, supports historical and testing seasons.
- `force`: If set to `false`, disables throttling and returns 304 if no updates (`force=true` returns the latest data).
- Data can be filtered by team, player, game, and stat abbreviations.

***

**Error Codes:**
- 200: Success
- 204: Content not found
- 304: No content change since last request (&force=false)
- 400: Malformed request (format, league, season, feed name, game ID, etc.)
- 401: Not authenticated
- 403: Not authorized (requires subscription for in-progress seasons)
- 429: Too many requests (throttling limits)
- 500/499/502/503: System errors, commonly temporary

***

**Throttling & Limits:**
- **General limit:** 200 requests per 5 minutes.
- **Heavy feeds:** Some (player stats, gamelogs, projections) require a "backoff" delay (5, 15, or 30 seconds).
- **Minute limit:** 100 request credits per minute (requests + accrued backoff seconds).
- **Avoid throttling:** Use `force=false` when possible for caching.

***

**Field & Data Conventions:**
- Unique, stable global IDs for players, teams, games, venues.
- Dates: 
  - v1.x feeds use `YYYYMMDD`.
  - v2.x feeds use ISO-8601.
- **Stat abbreviations:** For filtering data, use comma-delimited codes in `playerstats` or `teamstats` URL params.

***

**Testing, Development & Simulated Data:**
- **Scrambled API:** Use `scrambled-api.mysportsfeeds.com` for testing -- free, with scrambled/truncated data.
- **Simulated Seasons:** For continuous testing, use seasons like `testing-preseason`, `testing-regular`, `testing-playoff`.
- **Live Game Replay:** For testing play-by-play or box scores, start a single replay from your account dashboard.

***

**Projections:**
- Seasonal totals and game-by-game projections (player only).
- Projections for DFS fantasy points and stat totals.
- Note: Projections update regularly; game log projections presume player participation.

***

**PUSH Notifications:**
- Currently under redesign; all data access is via PULL (HTTP GET).

***

**Charting & Coordinates (Advanced):**
- Play-by-play data may include charting data (x/y coordinates) of plays.
    - **NBA coordinate system:** Away team left, home team right; origin at top-left of court.

***

**Wrapper Libraries & Code Samples:**
- Official wrappers available at [MySportsFeeds GitHub](https://github.com/MySportsFeeds).
- Examples included for key endpoints and authentication.

***

**Personal vs. Commercial Usage:**
- **Personal:** Free CORE data (latest 2 seasons, scores/schedules); must request personal account status.
- **Commercial:** Paid; all data and feeds available, best-value pricing.

***

**Properties Returned in Feeds:**
- `lastUpdatedOn`: ISO-8601 timestamp of data generation.
- `game.schedule`: Details include startTime, IDs, teams, venue, status, played status.
- `game.score`: Current period, total scores, period-by-period breakdown.
- DFS/contest properties for fantasy data.
- Seasonal, daily, game-by-game properties for teams and players.

***

**Summary for NBA Integration:**

- **Authenticate** via Basic Auth (`api_key_token:MYSPORTSFEEDS`).
- **Access feeds** using RESTful GET requests, data in JSON/XML/CSV.
- **Select feeds** by season, data type (schedule, stats, boxscore, injuries, projections, DFS, odds).
- **Observe throttling, response codes, and conventions.**
- **Develop/test** with scrambled and simulated data.
- **Chart data** available for advanced visualizations.
- **Reference wrapper libraries for rapid coding in Python/Node/etc.**

If you need **specific endpoint documentation, parameter options, or code samples** for any NBA stat feed, let me know which feed/endpoint you want code for!
You can feed all the above to your AI code builder and generate tailored integrations or wrappers.
